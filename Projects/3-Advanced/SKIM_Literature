# Hacktoberfest Contribution Proposal

## Project Name:

PubMed 200k RCT: Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts

## Description:

The project aims to replicate the deep learning model presented in the 2017 paper "PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts." The goal is to create an NLP model that classifies sentences in medical abstracts into different roles (e.g., objective, methods, results) to aid researchers in skimming through literature efficiently.

## Proposed Changes:

- **Days 1-2:** Download dataset and implement preprocessing functions.
- **Days 3-4:** Set up baseline models and conduct initial experiments.
- **Days 5-7:** Implement deep models with different embeddings and positional embeddings.
- **Days 8-10:** Build multimodal model and replicate the architecture from the referenced paper.
- **Days 11-12:** Analyze wrong predictions and fine-tune models.
- **Days 13-15:** Make predictions on external PubMed abstracts.

## Skills Required:

- Python programming
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TensorFlow and deep learning concepts

## Why This Contribution Matters:

The increasing number of released RCT papers poses a challenge for researchers. A model capable of classifying sentences in abstracts can significantly improve the efficiency of skimming through literature, enabling researchers to identify relevant information quickly.
